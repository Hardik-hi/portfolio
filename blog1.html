<h3>What does Meghalaya store for a photographer?</h3>

A few years back, I got a chance to visit Meghalaya-the land of the clouds. A great family trip it was, but the place is a haven for someone who is a big fan of capturing nature in pixels. I used a Microsoft Lumia 540- the Windows phone with a better camera other phones had those days.(yes, I am an amatuer clicker...)
</p>
<p><img class="body_image" src="nature\n8.jpg" ></img>
The trip indeed was a wonderful experience in many ways, but it made me a better at clicking photos, especially nature photography. Meghalaya is full of places to shoot- mountains with a tint of green, thanks to the great pine and cedar trees,the silky water of the waterfalls, majestic clouds, fairyland houses, caves full of textures and shades, barely found anywhere else.
And I did not find myself alone at that place- there were many like me exploring the majestic Himalayan Paradise, with those digital eyes in their hands, each being different from one other mainly in the perspective.
</p>
<p>
Meghalaya(Northeast India,as a matter of fact) is on the To-Do list of many photographers not only because of the mountains and trees; the culture of Meghalaya is brilliant- the vividness of the culture of the Khasi tribe fills the eyes with colours that altogether complete the spectrum of the wonderful place. Mawlynnong is the perfect place to be for anyone who wants a glimpse of culture of the place. Declared as "the cleanest village in Asia", the place offers a lot to capture- from wooden toys to bamboo houses; Mawlynnong is best for macro and closeup shots.
</p>
<p> So grab your bag and start exploring "Majestic Meghalaya" through your lens-you won't regret it! Till then, <i>Khublei</i>(Khasi:"Goodbye")!

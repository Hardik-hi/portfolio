<p>
Minimalism-the one word that defines design in the 21st century is one of the trending topics.Brands like Apple have used this concept quite successfully when it comes to connecting the user with the brand. Even in photography, this concept has vital role- this blog is not a "how-to" nor it is going to teach you that(I am too amateur for that); I've just put my thoughts on what it means to me and when I capture photos. 
</p>
<p>
I have lately realised the importance of minimalism in photography and how it conveys a greater sense of emotion and calmness to the viewer. It is not about bringing less to the table, but bringing what matters more. Seemingly complex yet simple at the same time, it is not only about a grayscale image with two to three things in it, and it is nothing more than efficient design. This complexity of minimalism is what makes it unique and appealing. What one needs to consider while thinking about minimalism is that it should convey great in less.
</p>


<p>
What's more exciting about minimalism is that it can be found anywhere-not only in fine arts or photography; whether it be a minimalist lifestyle or a even space, wherever human senses can explore(and maybe even beyond that), minimalism is omnipresent.
And closely associated with minimalism is spirituality. Spirituality is about being in touch with oneself, more of self-awareness. Fundamentally, it is about finding your inner-self, your interests.
And minimalism is pure balance. Sprituality brings awareness, awareness brings balance, which brings freedom. Minimalist lifestyle is not necessarily one where you leave everything, it is a lifestyle that brings balance in life, in everything you do.
</p>
<p> 
In these times when technology and humanity are at the verge of a new revolution, adopting minimalism goes a long way in not only sustaining life on the planet for the generations to come, but also advancing towards greater technology and a better version of ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Explore inside, and let the balance and bliss happen!
